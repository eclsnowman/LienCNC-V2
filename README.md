Hello and welcome to my Github for the LienCNC V2, which is a CNC router I designed as an upgrade to my previous CNC Router. I completed this new router design and build during December of 2020. The previous router I used was the R7 CNC which was a project I helped develop with my friend Brandon who owned SMW3D/HobbyFab. The R7 CNC was a great machine and cut all the aluminum parts required to build my new machine. The majority of the work I do on my router is cutting aluminum, so I wanted something with higher stiffness, higher mass for dampening vibrations, and all around overbuilt just how I like it.

This performance of this new machine checks all the boxes I had hoped for during my time in Solidworks designing the upgrade. The major specifications for this CNC design are as follows:

Construction: 8020 Aluminum Profiles and ½” ATP-5 Cast tooling plates
Motion: RM1605 (5mm pitch) Ball Screws, HGR20 Linear Rails, Nema24 3Nm Closed Loop Steppers
Spindle: 2.2KW ER20 220V 24000RPM Spindle
Controls: Minisforum UM300 MiniPC into CNCDrive AXBB-E Controller w/ UCSB Breakout
Software: CNCDrive UCCNC 1.2113
Power Supplies: 48V/20A Main PSU, 24V/2.5A PSU, 5V10A PSU, 48V-to-12V 5A Buck Converter
Machine Travel: X=738mm  /  Y=724.5mm  /  Z=129mm
Max Speed: X=8,000mm/min  /  Y=10,000mm/min  /  Z = 8,000mm/min

In the files I have on this Github are all my native Solidworks 2018 design files, as well as those files converted into many other 3D formats including; Fusion360, Step, Iges, Etc. In addition, I have included PDF, DXF, and DWG prints for all the major fabricated components and assemblies. The manuals for all the components that I referenced for configuring my build are also included. Lastly I have included my UCCNC configuration *.pro” file. 

The only item I have not included is a wiring diagram. Unfortunately the time it would take to make a wiring diagram to the caliber I could feel proud of is just not something I have time for right now. Building a CNC requires a fairly ample back catalog of knowledge to take on. If the wiring of a project like using the electrical manuals is not something you feel comfortable with, then seeking advice from an expert on your project would be advised. That being said I have included pictures and 3D models of my electrical cabinet design that you could use as reference on your own project.

I hope the files, resources, pictures, and designs I have provided here can help you if you decide to take on this project. And if you don’t build this design, I hope these resources can act as a jumping off point for your own project.

If you find any errors that I should correct please feel free to submit a pull request with the changes, or submit an issue and I will do my best to correct the problem as time allows.

Happy Making,
– Eric Lien
